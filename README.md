#  MyRadio

An alternate livestream radio player to listen to SRG radio stations using their livestreams.
Access to the SRG SSR API requires a valid API key and secret (see `Config.xcconfig`) which can be obtained from the [SRG SSR developer portal](https://developer.srgssr.ch).

Another interesting learning project covering the following topics:

- SwiftUI
- Combine
- REST API using OAuth authentication
- AVFoundation/AVKit for a custom audio player and "Now Playing" & remote control
- Spotlight
- iOS Extensions
    - Siri extension
    - Widget extension
- Settings bundle
- App groups to share data between main app and extensions
